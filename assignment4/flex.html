          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth. “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined
          the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard
          some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
          free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
          of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
          careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          The team was very supportive and kept me motivated “ I started as a
          total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile
          engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve
          made in myself.
